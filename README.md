❤️ Always 18+. I love sitting in the library, spawn, below the cafe, or the Marvel area. 


❤️ I have the basic DNI criteria. I shouldn't need to go into detail. MINORS DNI, Homophobes, Proshippers, Pedophiles, Supporters of ANY of these,  anti-LGBTQ, racists, sexists, zoophiles, terfs, transphobes. and so forth, stay away from me. Thank you. If for whatever reason you're just an asshole to be an asshole or it's "cool", you can definitely stay away from me. 


❤️ Main run down ;; I am off-tab a lot. I accept cuddles, hiding behind, kisses, and boops on the silly pony game.  Please interact with me! Whether it is through open chat or whispers, I encourage interaction! I will say, I am an easily anxious and shy person, so I do apologize in advance. I usually am sitting with friends or alone, like I said, don't be afraid to interact with me. let me know if I can sit with you 💜. If for whatever reason I move away from you, chances are is I just got anxious or I felt as though I was intruding. I do love to roleplay! I find it very fun :). I do not hide often. If I have hidden you;; whether temporarily or permanently, you must have made me uncomfortable in some sort of way or it was in my best interest. Sorry. 

❤️ I am a HEAVY believer in kinning, comfort characters and ocs x canon. 100% if you don't support either, then maybe you and I shouldn't talk. 


❤️ Fandoms and interests ;;; Marvel, I'm getting into the DC verse, My little pony, Slenderverse, Warrior cats, Stardew Valley, The Sims, Horror, FNAF, Creepypasta, Doctor Who, Nature / crime documentaries. 


❤️ ;; I favorite Bucky Barnes, Hawkeye, Logan Howlett, Scott Summers, Natasha Romanoff,  Tony Stark, and Jean Grey when it comes to Marvel. Marvel seems to be my main and current fandom, haha. Bucky, Logan, and Natasha are comforts.

❤️ I am diagnosed with ADHD, Autism, and anxiety. I may not understand social cues.  I am heavily expressive and will type in caps to express myself. I am a yapper once you get to know me. If I am yapping too much, please tell me. 


❤️ ;;;  My socials are open for everyone. Either you can paw around for them, or just ask. I am mostly active on Discord;; cactusmilk
